# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Employee Management System

The **Employee Management System** is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It allows users to manage employee information, perform CRUD operations, and handle user authentication. The system is designed to be fully responsive, with separate CSS for each page and a modern, intuitive user interface.

## Features

- User Authentication (Login/Signup)
- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations for Employee Data
- Employee Profile Management (with fields like name, email, mobile number, designation, gender, and course)
- Image Upload for Employee Profiles
- Search and Filter Employees
- Real-time updates and form validation
- Client-side and Server-side Validation
- Fully responsive UI with dedicated CSS for each page

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React**: for building the user interface and handling state.
- **CSS**: for styling the components with separate CSS files for each page.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: for handling the backend logic.
- **Express.js**: for creating server-side routes and middleware.
- **MongoDB** (Atlas): as the database to store employee details.
- **Mongoose**: for object modeling and database interactions.

### Additional Tools

- **Multer**: for handling image uploads.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: for secure authentication.
- **Bcrypt**: for password hashing.
- **Validator**: for data validation.
